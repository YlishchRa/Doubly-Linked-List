## count start like on any array from 0 to "n"

## you can push_back/front data and pop_back/front data
## also here is method insert - first value is a index(place) where you want to insert, second data
## elements are placed before the current value at this at this index

## if you put on place less then 0 elemet will add to front list
## also it`s work if place more then size but in this case element will be add to back list

## method erase take index(place) as argument, and delete node from list by this index(place)
## if you enter index(place) less then 0 then will be delete first element(0)
## also it`s work if you enter more then size but in this case will be deleted
